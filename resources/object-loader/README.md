# ObjectLoader

This is a resource for [FiveReborn](http://www.fivereborn.com/) that loads object files from [Map 
Editor](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/map-editor) (and some "Spooner" format) on clients.

It also comes with a teleport handler (use **/mtp** in the chat to view teleports) and has some API calls.

Some example maps are included in the **[examples]** folder.

To use, start the `object-loader` resource, an object resource (like `stunt-chiliad`) and optionally the `object-teleports` 
resource.
